To add: 


Technically Ala Cb-Ca too and this needs 15N decoupling
K and maybe others need 15N decoupling in the indirect dimension for long TJ

pl17 has generally been around 1000Hz for our stuff
can we take pl17 out of the base calibration and put into autocal

How do we now cite who has written it and against what date
;"-DCT records t1 in a constant time manner"


why bf1 not sf01 "cnst21=o1/bf1"


O1P 		- Ct
CNST22 		- CP
CNST2 		- Jcc
pl17		- 850Hz


"d11=30m"
"d12=15u"
"d13=15u"
       "pwc90_Ct=p11"
       "pwc90_Cp=p13"
       "pwc180_Ct=p15"
       "pwc180_Cp=p16"
       "pwc_dip=p17"
       "pwd=p41"
       "taua=1s/(cnst2*4.)"
       "TC=1s/(cnst2*1.)"
flopsytime
l1
ap_flg
maxtd
l11



To Do:

Check the not CT d0!
Check maxTD calc
Hard write warning on FLOPSYTIME?
Hard write warning on amount of 2H decoupling!
