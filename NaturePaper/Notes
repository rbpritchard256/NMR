* The sequence matches what is in the suppl but have not checked that it is the one used to get the published data
** This sequence looked close to that published in the suppl than cecd_3d_JCC_2H_ipap_800_dfh_v3_2


Questions:

## General
	Format/information content for headers
	Authorship in headers?
	Instructions work
	All variables described, correctly and with useful suggested values
	Sufficient comments going through?

	Does "cw" work on other spectrometers? / should we change all to cpd4?
	max power for cw D decoupling: 20.0, 6.5, 5
	max power for cw D decoupling: 125u 200u, 230u
   	max power for waltx D decoupling: 2.5  6.5

	Should we suggest autocal power for deuterium decoupling?
	Should we suggest decoupling values

	Any checks for the number of points in the relaxation experiments?
	
	Write a check for the total duration of the experiment (total ms D decoupling?)

## CEST
	Should we rewrite the Calib CEST experiment as well?
	what is d17 - not described anywhere

## JCC 
	fq change in the coupling evolution is only 10u (otherwise 30u)
	This line at the end, what does it do?
